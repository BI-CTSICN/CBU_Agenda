RE: ** Letter of Support for Proposal to the XXXXX titled   “XXXXXX”**

Dear Dr. X,

This letter is to formally acknowledge that the Children’s Bioinformatics Unit at the Children’s National Medical Center is pleased to provide all the bioinformatics support for the XXXXXX  proposed in your grant application cited above.

Our unit provides investigators with core bioinformatics and computational biology expertise to manage and analyze large molecular datasets like RNA, Whole Genome and Exome, T-Cell Receptor, Methylation, Chip sequencing etc, apart from regular array type analysis. Our aim is to assist investigators in the development of customized pipelines to provide solutions to hypothesis-driven biological experiments and derive meaningful results from exploration of large data sets. Next-generation sequencing data is the focus of most of our projects, but we do also encounter other biological datasets all the time. Our emphasis is on genomics and systems biology with an overarching goal of  personalized medicine. We also provide expertise in statistical analysis and training where applicable.

The CBU was established in November 2017, led by Dr. Eric Vialin, Director, Center for Genetic Medicine Research and Dr. Hiroki Morizono, Director, CBU with generous support from Dr. Vittorio Gallo, Chief Research Officer, Center for Translational Science, Clinical and Translational Institute at Children’s National (CTSI-CN) and the District of Columbia Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center (DC-IDDRC) at Children’s National Medical Center. Our staff works closely with the Genomics Core at Children’s and other bioinformatics-oriented research groups at George Washington University in the development of new algorithms and software tools. 

 We look forward to working with you and are confident that we will provide the highest quality data analysis to help answer important research questions. Please feel free to email us (bioinformatics@chilrensnational.org), if you have any questions.

Sincerely,
Dr. Hiroki Morizono
Director
Children’s Bioinformatics Unit

### Authorship
Per the guidelines of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE)[1], authorship credit is indicated when the following four conditions are met:
•	substantial contributions to: the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis or interpretation of data for the work
•	drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content
•	final approval of the version to be published
•	agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved
Therefore, members of the CRI Bioinformatics Unit who contribute substantially to study design, implementation, analysis and/or interpretation should be offered the opportunity to earn authorship on all abstracts, presentations and manuscripts stemming from joint collaborations with investigators seeking support. Investigators should invite their collaborators in the CRI Bioinformatics Unit to participate in drafting and revising abstracts and manuscripts.

Authorship order should be discussed prior to the initiation of the collaboration. The order tends to vary and often depends upon the specific contributions of the collaborating bioinformatician(s). For example, it is customary for faculty bioinformaticians who have participated in the design, analysis, conduct and manuscript preparation of a clinical trial to be listed as second author. For studies requiring an intensive or high-end bioinformatics analysis, it is also customary to list the faculty bioinformatician(s) among the first three authors. Staff bioinformaticians are typically listed as middle authors.
Decisions about authorship are not related to funding arrangements between investigators and their collaborators in the CRI Bioinformatics Unit.

### Pipelines 

## RNA Seq
•  FastQ files containing the raw RNA-Seq reads output from the sequencers are first checked for quality using FastQC.
It is followed by trimming of poor quality reads using any of the following tools:
•	Trimmomatic
•	BBDuk
•	cutadapt
An aligner is used to align the reads to the reference genome (Human/Mouse etc) using any of the following tools:
•	Tophat2
•	Hisat2
•	STAR
The aligned Sequence Alignment Map (SAM) files are sorted and converted to BAM using samtools in some cases.
Next, the Binary Alignment Map (BAM) files are checked for their quality using either of the following tools:
•	Picard RNASeqmetrics
•	RSeQC
In cases for fusion gene detection, we specifically use either the Tophat-fusion or STAR-Fusion tool. While splicing events are identified using SGSe tool part of the biocondutor package in R.
Quantification of reads to Transcripts per million (TPM) is calculated using RSEM.
For cases of high sequence duplication, we tag the duplicates using Picard MarkDuplicates and count the duplicated reads using featureCounts. In many cases of overduplication we also remove the duplicated reads using Picard MarkDuplicates.
For raw unnormalized counts, we use either of the following tools:
•	Htseq Counts
•	featureCounts
For Differential Gene expression, we use either the following packages in R:
•	Deseq2
•	EdgeR
•	Ebseq2
The final data can be represented in the form of heatmaps, volcano plots, MA plots and PCA plots using basic R packages.

## WGS/Exome Seq
•  •  The raw sequencing data in fastqc files is first quality checked with FastQC and depending upon the quality it is trimmed using the following tools.
•	Trimmomatic
•	BBDuk
•	cutadapt
An aligner is used to align the reads to the reference genome (Human/Mouse etc) using any of the following tools:
•	Bwa-mem
•	Bowtie2
The aligned Sequence Alignment Map (SAM) files are processed to Binary Alignment Map (BAM) files:
•	samtools
•	Picard tools
We follow the Genome Analysis Toolkit 4 (GATK 4), pipeline to do Variant Calling. The BAM files are further processed for using Base Quality Score Recalibration (BQSR) step to detect and correct base calling errors from sequencers:
•	BaseRecalibrator
•	ApplyBQSR
Variant calling is performed on the aligned BAM files, producing genome variant call format (gvcf) files using HaplotypeCaller function.
The gvcfs are combined using CombineGVCFs function, followed by running the GenotypeGVCFs function, to increase the sensitivity of the variants called. Output of this step is a vcf file,
The vcf file is then further processed using Variant Quality Score Recalibration (VQSR) tools to increase the quality of variants identified, i.e. decrease the number of false positives.
•	VariantRecalibrator
•	ApplyVQSR
Annotation of variant is done using Annovar, followed by manual filtration.

## T-Cell Receptor Sequencing
•  •  The raw sequencing data in fastqc files is first quality checked with FastQC and depending upon the quality it is trimmed using the following tools:
•	Trimmomatic
•	BBDuk
•	cutadapt
Extraction and alignment of fragments of target molecules is performed followed by assembly of overlapping fragmented sequencing reads into long-enough CDR3 containing contigs using the MiXCR pipeline to analyze TCR or Ig repertoire from sequencing data.

## Metagenomics/Microbiome
•  The raw sequencing data in fastqc files is first quality checked with FastQC and depending upon the quality it is trimmed using the following tools.
•	Trimmomatic
•	BBDuk
•	cutadapt
We perform demultiplexing and quality filtering, OTU picking, taxonomic assignment, and phylogenetic reconstruction, and diversity analyses and visualizations using QIIME1 pipeline.
