title: 20th September Meeting Agenda
---
### Topics for Discussion :

* Seminar 
    * Applications of Optical Genome	 - Hayk	- October 1rst

* Profiling  - Mihailo

* HPC resources for outside CBU
  *Eg: Syaikh Zyad
  What happens when people outside CBU ask for servers? Do we point to Colonial One?
  If we do, do they need to pay for this yearly, because they are using this resource.
  
* Grants - Since we don't have a pricing, how to budget while writing for Grants especially for outside Children's
  Eg: GW Dominic Raj
    * Actual Work Pricing
    * Server costs
    * Data Storage costs (if applicable)
    
    We need a standard policy for grants and allocation of efforts.
    
* Bear Institute (Cerner) Genomics and Data Inegration Pipeline - Hiroki
